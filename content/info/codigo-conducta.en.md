# Code of Conduct
## Purpose
A primary goal of all conferences and user groups that refer to this Code of Conduct is to be inclusive to the largest number of people, with the most diverse range of backgrounds and knowledge possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, socio-economic status, religion, or belief.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the community, as well as the consequences of unacceptable behavior.

We invite all participants in our events to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Open Code/Culture/Technology Citizenship
A secondary goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open code/culture/technology citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute fully, we would love to know.

## Expected Behavior
Participate in an authentic and active way. Doing so helps to contribute to the health and longevity of this community.  
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Try to collaborate to avoid conflicts.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

## Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community, online or in all related events and one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community activities. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior
If you are subjected to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. You can find a list of organizers to contact at the bottom of this page.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members contact local law enforcement or otherwise assist those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts to those experiencing distress.

## Grievances
If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify a community organizer with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be reviewed and resolved according to the community’s policies.

## Scope
We expect all community participants (contributors — paid or otherwise —, sponsors, and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues — online and in-person — as well as in all one-on-one communications related to community business.
