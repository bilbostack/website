# Cansu Karayel
I came from Turkey to Barcelona 14 years ago with eDreams as a Product Analyst, and since then I have built my career as a Product Manager in the Digital sector.
For over 2 years, I have collaborated with AllWomen to support and guide professionals who want to develop as Product Managers.
Throughout my career, I have worked in companies of different sizes and sectors and with a wide variety of products. But every day I keep finding new learnings and challenges that fuel my motivation for what I do.
