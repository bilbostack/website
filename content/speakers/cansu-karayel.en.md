# Cansu Karayel

I came from Turkey to Barcelona 14 years ago with eDreams as a Product Analyst, and since then I have built my career as a Product Manager in the Digital sector.

For over 2 years, I have collaborated with AllWomen to support and guide professionals who want to develop as Product Managers.

Throughout my career, I have worked in companies of different sizes and sectors and with a wide variety of products. But every day I keep finding new learnings and challenges that fuel my motivation for what I do.

## Her talk
**Culture Driven Development, the engine of a fast, effective, and sustainable team**

Your team has a clear and defined objective, now what?

How to achieve a safe environment where the team can act without asking for permission, but without everything ending in absolute chaos?
How to create a space of trust where decisions made are transparent, open for anyone to question without hindering progress?
How to be prepared as a team for any unexpected business turn and act quickly and without drama?

In this talk, we will tell you how we navigate the most common challenges of any product team.
We will share practical cases from our experience, what has worked for us, what hasn't, and where we still have a lot to work on.

Spoiler: it's not about having the latest framework or methodology, nor roadmaps, nor anything like that, but about putting the team at the "center of the experience".
