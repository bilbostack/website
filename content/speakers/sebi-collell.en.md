# Sebi Collell

In the past, I was a developer, but I realized there are many people better at programming than me. I went through some management positions in various technology consulting firms, but my "competitive self" led me to seek a context where I could enjoy myself and, if possible, feel that I could contribute something. I ended up finding it at the intersection of technology and business that product management provides, a place where I feel at home, and where I believe is the "core" of any company where technology is a pillar for scaling the business.
