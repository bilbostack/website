# Sebi Collell

In the past, I was a developer, but I realized there are many people better at programming than me. I went through some management positions in various technology consulting firms, but my "competitive self" led me to seek a context where I could enjoy myself and, if possible, feel that I could contribute something. I ended up finding it at the intersection of technology and business that product management provides, a place where I feel at home, and where I believe is the "core" of any company where technology is a pillar for scaling the business.

### His talk

Your team has a clear and defined objective, now what?

How to achieve a safe environment where the team can act without asking for permission, but without everything ending in absolute chaos?
How to create a space of trust where decisions made are transparent, open for anyone to question without hindering progress?
How to be prepared as a team for any unexpected business turn and act quickly and without drama?

In this talk, we will tell you how we navigate the most common challenges of any product team.
We will share practical cases from our experience, what has worked for us, what hasn't, and where we still have a lot to work on.

Spoiler: it's not about having the latest framework or methodology, nor roadmaps, nor anything like that, but about putting the team at the "center of the experience".
