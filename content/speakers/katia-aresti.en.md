**In-Memory Databases: use cases and solutions for modern applications**

In-memory databases are not new but have become very popular in recent years due to their incredible performance and speed. In this talk, we will see how they can solve several common problems in applications in 2025. We will talk about cases such as storing temporary data, improving scalability, accelerating queries, and managing sessions, among others. With practical examples, I will show you how to implement these solutions and how to easily integrate in-memory databases into your backend applications to make them much faster and more efficient.
