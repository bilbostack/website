# Fernando Díaz Garrido

I have spent 20 years wandering around the world trying to make my contribution to product companies.

Now settled in Valencia, I am creating an observability platform at Alhona to help manufacturing companies better understand what is happening in their factories.

I am obsessed with fast feedback cycles, maximizing frequency, and minimizing cycle size to learn early and reduce risk.

I love building products for the physical world: logistics, warehouses, factories...

### His talk
**When robots learn to talk: Stories of smart factories and data streams**

Almost two years ago, I embarked on an adventure at Alhona with the goal of making the manufacturing industry more competitive. The idea was to build a data product that would provide factories with a real-time 360º view of their plant. The funny thing is, when I started, I didn't know much about data or factories.

In this talk, I will share from a novice's perspective the lessons learned during this time: from delving into the world of robots and industrial protocols to understanding how data streams can become the key to making decisions on the shop floor.
