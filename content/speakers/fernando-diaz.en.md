# Fernando Díaz Garrido

I have spent 20 years wandering around the world trying to make my contribution to product companies.   

Now settled in Valencia, I am creating an observability platform at Alhona to help manufacturing companies better understand what is happening in their factories.  

I am obsessed with fast feedback cycles, maximizing frequency, and minimizing cycle size to learn early and reduce risk.  

I love building products for the physical world: logistics, warehouses, factories...
