# Jordi MartÃ­ Carrera

With more than 20 years of experience in the development world, I have worked in very diverse teams, helping people and different businesses grow through the use of technology.

I am passionate about creating new solutions in collaboration with other people. Maybe that's why I love escape rooms or collaborative board games ðŸ˜…

### His talk
**What if "doing the right thing" wasn't the right thing**

"Doing the right thing right" has become our mantra, our compass, our new dogma. We design products as lean as possible, move forward with small safe steps, and take care of every line of code with practices aligned to XP.

ENOUGH! This strict "duty to do the right thing" is starting to weigh us down as a team and as individuals. In this talk, I would like to explore how the pressure of working this way may be damaging our dynamics and wearing down our team.

Do you think this doesn't happen in your team? Neither did I.
