# Mikel Ors Valle

I am a Software Engineer from Bizkaia with over 20 years in the industry, occupying different roles. In recent years, I have been focused on the worlds of Data Engineering and Technical Leadership, and I am passionate about teaching, which has led me to be a professor of different subjects in various places throughout all these years.  

Beyond that, I am an enthusiast of software quality and well-understood agility. I see Software Engineering as teamwork, where the most important and complex aspect is always the people, which is why I live with the conviction that it's the first thing we need to take care of in order to create good software.  

On another note, I love cycling, running slowly, and I play several instruments, although I do all of this with much more enthusiasm than skill. And I'm crazy about Indian food.
