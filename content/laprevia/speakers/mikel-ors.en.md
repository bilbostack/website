# Mikel Ors Valle

I am a Software Engineer from Bizkaia with over 20 years in the industry, occupying different roles. In recent years, I have been focused on the worlds of Data Engineering and Technical Leadership, and I am passionate about teaching, which has led me to be a professor of different subjects in various places throughout all these years.

Beyond that, I am an enthusiast of software quality and well-understood agility. I see Software Engineering as teamwork, where the most important and complex aspect is always the people, which is why I live with the conviction that it's the first thing we need to take care of in order to create good software.

On another note, I love cycling, running slowly, and I play several instruments, although I do all of this with much more enthusiasm than skill. And I'm crazy about Indian food.

## His talk{#talk}
**The trap of hard work in software development**

Working very hard has always been considered a positive thing. Understanding it as the act of putting in maximum effort, ensuring that we are always permanently busy doing things, and even going beyond what is necessary by putting in extra hours. Who wouldn't want a team made up of people who work like that? Well, if what we want to do is quality software that adds value, maybe working like that is not the best idea.

I believe in Software Engineering as an intellectual and creative job that is done in collaboration with people, in a constantly changing environment. In this talk, we will explore the principle of "Work Smarter, Not Harder" applied to software development. I will explain why I believe that hard work can negatively affect not only developers but also the quality of the software they produce. I will also share ideas and strategies that have worked for me and my teams, always with the goal of generating quality software that adds value.
