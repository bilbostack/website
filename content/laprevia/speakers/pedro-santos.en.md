# Pedro Santos

Agile Technical Coach | I empower software engineering teams to deliver high-quality software more quickly and efficiently. As a technical coach and software quality consultant, I specialize in analyzing bottlenecks, assisting in the formation of high-performance teams, and most importantly, prioritizing knowledge transfer. My experience includes BDD, DDD, TDD, software architecture, test automation, CI/CD, code quality, and technical processes. In the last ten years, I have focused on mentoring other developers. I have spent hundreds of hours in group programming sessions, training and tutoring developers of all skill levels, working on topics ranging from basic programming concepts to object-oriented design principles, legacy application refactoring, testing, architectural decisions, and professional development options.

I am the lead author of "Agile Technical Practices Distilled: A Journey toward Mastering Software Design," available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.es/Agile-Technical-Practices-Distilled-principles/dp/1838980849) and [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/agiletechnicalpracticesdistilled).

## His talk
**There has never been a better time to work in software engineering**

The world today is qualitatively much better than when I started my career over thirty years ago. People and companies have improved. There are still challenges, but today we have access to an amount of information and communities unimaginable three decades ago. With great satisfaction, I have witnessed an increase in the degree of people's fulfillment much faster than I could have ever imagined. There has never been a better time to work in software engineering.
